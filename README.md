~~Ever wanted to play a fantasy soccer app that didn't exclude a portion of significant 
players?  This web app is for you.~~
a fantasy sports app for european soccer was the original vision but right now this is just being used
as a web scraper to help inform my sports betting.  I might get to the second half if I have the time

* Ruby version
    ruby version 3.2.2

* System dependencies
    either use of selenium internally or an API call to retrieve player data(TBD)
